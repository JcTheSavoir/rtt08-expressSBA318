Project Name: SBA 318 - Express Server Application
Creator: J.C.
Date Started: 4/18/2024

Project Info: 
This project is used to measures a learners understanding of Node and Express, along with their capability to implement these features in a practical manner.

//---------------------Main Objectives-----------//
* Create a server application with Node and Express.
* Create a RESTful API using Express.
* Create Express middleware.
* Use Express middleware.
* Use a template engine to render views with Express.
* Interact with a self-made API through HTML forms.

//-----------------------------Main Requirements and Weights-----------------//
* Create and use at least two pieces of custom middleware.
Weight: 5%
* Create and use error-handling middleware.
Weight: 5%
* Use at least three different data categories (e.g., users, posts, or comments).
Weight: 5%
* Utilize reasonable data structuring practices.
Weight: 5%
* Create GET routes for all data that should be exposed to the client.
Weight: 5%
* Create POST routes for data, as appropriate. At least one data category should allow for client creation via a POST request.
Weight: 5%
* Create PATCH or PUT routes for data, as appropriate. At least one data category should allow for client manipulation via a PATCH or PUT request.
Weight: 5%
* Create DELETE routes for data, as appropriate. At least one data category should allow for client deletion via a DELETE request.
Weight: 5%
* Include query parameters for data filtering, where appropriate. At least one data category should allow for additional filtering through the use of query parameters.
Note: Using API keys is dissallowed
Weight: 5%
* Utilize route parameters, where appropriate.
Weight: 5%
* Adhere to the guiding principles of REST.
Weight: 10%
* Create and render at least one view using a view template and template engine. This can be a custom template engine or a third-party engine.
Note: If you are stuck on how to approach this, think about ways you could render the current state of your API's data for easy viewing.
Weight: 8%
* Use simple CSS to style the rendered views.
Note: This is not a test of design; it is a test of serving static files using Express. The CSS can be
very simple.
Weight: 2%
* Include a form within a rendered view that allows for interaction with your RESTful API.
Weight: 3%
* Utilize reasonable code organization practices.
Weight: 5%
* Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).
Weight: 10%
* Commit frequently to the git repository.
Weight: 5%
* Include a README file that contains a description of your application.
Weight: 2%
* Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience.
Weight: 5%

//--------------Bonus Requirements {not required}-------------//
* Include a practical usage of regular expressions within route paths.
Note: A forced, arbitrary usage of this technique will not earn you any bonus credit. This must be
practical and sensible in order to be considered for credit.
Weight: +1%
* Research and eff ectively use at least one third-party Node package for practical, sensible purposes.
This cannot be a package that has been used in examples and lesson materials thus far. Step outside the box and be creative!
